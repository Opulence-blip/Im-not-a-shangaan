                    <p>FRELIMO conducted its early military training near Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. This strategic location provided a safe base outside of Portuguese-controlled Mozambique, allowing FRELIMO fighters to prepare and organize their armed struggle for independence. The support from Tanzania and other neighboring countries was crucial in helping Mozambique’s liberation movement gain momentum during this period.</p>

                        <p>The freedom fighters gathered to prepare for their struggle against Portuguese colonial forces. FRELIMO’s leader, Dr. Eduardo Mondlane, declared that the armed fight had officially begun with full commitment. He stated that their forces numbered thousands of volunteers, exclusively Mozambicans, emphasizing that recruitment from other countries was prohibited to keep the struggle a national effort.</p>
                        <p>Recruits received initial training at Bagamoyo before moving to two secret camps further inland in Tanzania for advanced preparation, locations strictly off-limits to the press. While Mondlane did not disclose the sources of their arms, he acknowledged widespread international sympathy for their cause. Methodist minister and FRELIMO’s second-in-command, Uria Simango, who had fled Mozambique years earlier, was present alongside Mondlane.</p>
                        <p>FRELIMO reported that their raids in Mozambique’s interior had already resulted in the deaths of fifteen Portuguese soldiers. The conflict’s regional impact prompted calls for intervention, with Portugal urging Britain to prevent Tanganyika (now Tanzania) from being used as a base for insurgency in East and Central Africa.</p>

                        <h2>Mozambique Liberation Front Leader Seeks British Support in London (1968)</h2>
                        <p>In 1968, Dr. Eduardo Mondlane, leader of the Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO), addressed a meeting in London to seek support from the British public and government for Mozambique’s struggle for independence. During his speech, Mondlane highlighted the ongoing armed resistance against Portuguese colonial rule and emphasized the importance of international solidarity in achieving freedom. He called on Britain to recognize the legitimacy of FRELIMO’s cause and to provide political and moral backing to help end colonial oppression in Mozambique.</p>

                            <p>A solemn graveside ceremony was held on Tuesday to honor the memory of Dr. Eduardo Chivambo Mondlane, the founding president of FRELIMO (Mozambique Liberation Front), who played a pivotal role in Mozambique's struggle for independence.</p>
                            <p>The tribute took place at his final resting place, where Mrs. Mondlane, family members, and a number of mourners gathered to pay their respects. Among those present was President Samora Machel, who delivered a heartfelt speech commemorating Dr. Mondlane’s legacy and dedication to liberation. Information Minister Mr. Rebalo also addressed the crowd, reflecting on the values and vision that Mondlane championed during his lifetime.</p>
                            <p>The gravesite was adorned with wreaths, and mourners stood united beneath the freedom flag, symbolizing the enduring spirit of the movement Mondlane helped lead. A portrait of the late leader was displayed beside the grave, serving as a powerful reminder of his enduring impact on Mozambique's history.</p>
                            <br></br>
                            <p>It was only after Mozambique gained independence in 1975 that his remains were later reburied with honor at the Mozambique Heroes’ Square (Praça dos Heróis Moçambicanos) in Maputo — the official resting place for national heroes.</p>
